2,Granite,"Granite is a coarse-grained (phaneritic) intrusive igneous rock composed mostly of quartz, alkali feldspar, and plagioclase. It forms from magma with a high content of silica and alkali metal oxides that slowly cools and solidifies underground.

These range in size from dikes only a few centimeters across to batholiths exposed over hundreds of square kilometers."
